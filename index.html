              <strong>
              <p>Over a hundred years, the enigmatic Sherlock Holmes has eclipsed other detectives as the detective who has singlehandedly paved his own genre of forensic investigation. As a "consulting detective" in the stories. From preserving crime scenes and focusing on fingerprints, blood, and ballistics, Holmes was about 120 years ahead of his time, searching for minute traces of evidence beyond what the naked eye would notice. Sherlock Holmes was the first of his kind to emphasize the importance of an uncontaminated crime scene during police investigation, putting more effort into the facts of a case, rather than accepting what appears to be true.

          <p>Debuting in A Study in Scarlet in 1887, Arthur Conan 
            Doyle's depiction of Sherlock Holmes captivated 
            audiences with his abiliy to reach targeted conclusions 
            based on minute observations. While not the first 
            detective of his kind, Holmes has become synonymous 
            with forensic science and logical reasoning, becoming the quintessenial 
            renaissance man of looking beyond the surface to the heart
            of any case.</strong>
